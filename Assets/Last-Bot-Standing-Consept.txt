1. Last Bot Standing
Setting: Post-apocalyptic cities, rusted factories, and old war zones. Think of environments that showcase the decline of civilization and the rise of machines. The color palette can be muted, with splashes of neon or other vibrant colors to signify active robotic components or energy sources.

Gameplay:

Robot Abilities: Each robot type has its own set of abilities. For instance, spider-bots can climb walls, flying drones can access unreachable places, and tank-bots have heavy artillery. As the player possesses these bots, they can mix and match abilities for a limited time.
Energy: The player has an energy meter. Possessing robots and using abilities consumes energy. They must constantly seek out new bots or energy sources to survive.
Upgrades & Customization: As players progress, they can unlock or merge abilities, leading to more diverse gameplay.
Challenges: Some areas are inaccessible without specific robot abilities. Enemies can have shields against certain attacks, forcing players to strategize and change forms accordingly.

Narrative Depth: Flashbacks can reveal the events leading up to the AI apocalypse, perhaps hinting that the player's AI was involved somehow, leading to moral dilemmas.

Game Style: Orthograpic 3D Dungeon, Pixelated Styelized
